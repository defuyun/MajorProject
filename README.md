============

Welcome to the GitHub repo for our major project.

Don't copy!

List of things to do:
* Write functions to return a coordinate of an ARC or vertex given a 
path to the ARC/vertex (pathToARC() and pathToVertex())
* Write functions to tell whether an ARC or vertex is connected to
a campus/other ARC (isARCConnected() and isCampusConnected())
* Finish API functions
