MajorProject
============

Welcome to the GitHub repo for our major project.

Put a strike through a function when you think you've finished it. Once 
we confirm it is fully working, we can remove it from the list.

As you write static functions, add them to the unit tests file!

List of things to do:
* ~~newGame()~~
    * James
* makeAction()
    * Matt
* throwDice()
    * Tim
* ~~getCampus()~~
    * Carl
* ~~getARC()~~
    * Carl
* isLegalAction()
    * Mostly James, since he has less functions than other people
* getExchangeRate()
    * Matt
* ~~pathToARC~~
    * Carl
* ~~pathToVertex~~
    * Carl
* isARCConnected
    * Tim
* isCampusConnected
    * Tim
