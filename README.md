============

Welcome to the GitHub repo for our major project.

Put a strike through a function when you think you've finished it. Once 
we confirm it is fully working, we can remove it from the list.
List of things to do:
    * ~~newGame()~~
        * James
    * makeAction()
        * Matt
    * throwDice()
        * Tim
    * getCampus()
        * Carl
    * getARC()
        * Carl
