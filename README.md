List of things to do:
* Write functions to return a coordinate of an ARC or vertex given a 
path to the ARC/vertex (pathToARC() and pathToVertex())
* Write functions to tell whether an ARC or vertex is connected to
a campus/other ARC (isARCConnected() and isCampusConnected())
* Finish API functions
    * newGame()
    * makeAction()
    * throwDice()
    * getCampus()
    * getARC()
    * isLegalAction()
